The GBIF Data Validator is a service to provide a report on the syntactical correctness and the validity of content contained in a dataset.  It will allow for anybody to quickly determine issues in data without registering the dataset in GBIF.  This will provide the ability to easily do a *pre-publication* review of data.   This will support various data formats in use within GBIF including:

 - Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A): Occurrence, Taxon, Sampling Event
 - [Excel spreadsheets](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/new-darwin-core-spreadsheet-templates)
 - Simple CSV files using Darwin Core terms for header values
 - ABCD Archive (ABCD-A)

> Only formats where the data are represented in a single file are
> supported.  Where data is needed to be crawled (e.g. TAPIR) a separate
> process must crawl and reformat the data in advance.  BioCASe tools
> supports both ABCD-A and DwC-A as of 2015
